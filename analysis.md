Wallet Credit Score Analysis
This document provides an in-depth analysis of the credit scores generated for DeFi wallets based on their Aave V2 transaction history.

1. Credit Score Distribution
   The credit scores are assigned on a scale from 0 to 1000, with higher scores indicating more reliable and responsible behavior. The histogram below visualizes the distribution of these scores across all 3497 unique wallets in the dataset.

Observations:

The score distribution is heavily skewed towards the higher end of the spectrum.

Nearly 99.5% of the wallets (3478 out of 3497) fall into the 801-1000 (Very High) credit score range. This suggests that the majority of observed Aave V2 users in this dataset exhibit behaviors that are considered highly responsible and low-risk by the defined scoring logic.

A very small number of wallets are found in the lower and middle ranges:

0-200 (Very Low): 1 wallet (0.03%)

201-400 (Low): 1 wallet (0.03%)

401-600 (Medium): 2 wallets (0.06%)

601-800 (High): 15 wallets (0.43%)

The model successfully identifies outliers at both ends, with a Max Score of 1000 and a Min Score of 0, indicating its ability to span the full range based on the input features. The Average Score of approximately 913.45 further emphasizes the predominantly high scores in the dataset.

2. Wallet Behavior Across Score Ranges
   To gain insights into the characteristics distinguishing wallets in different score tiers, we analyzed the average values of several key engineered features for wallets grouped into the defined credit score ranges.

Average Feature Values by Score Range:
Score Range Avg. Total Transactions Avg. Activity Duration (Days) Avg. Num Unique Assets Avg. Total Deposit Value Avg. Total Borrow Value Avg. Total Repay Value Avg. Repay Ratio Avg. Borrow-to-Deposit Ratio Avg. Liquidation Call Count Avg. Was Liquidated Avg. Net Borrow Value Avg. Avg. Tx Amount
0-200 (Very Low) 240.00 51.00 1.00 152.00 1226.53 0.12 8.07 1.00 1.00 1074.53 5.16
201-400 (Low) 89.00 6.00 1.00 100.00 7583.87 0.00 75.84 1.00 1.00 7483.87 84.76
401-600 (Medium) 29.50 63.00 1.50 750.00 4469.19 0.16 5.96 1.00 1.00 3719.19 151.78
601-800 (High) 32.53 56.80 1.93 34098.66 44026.04 0.06 1.29 1.00 1.00 41423.80 106.90

Insights on Wallet Behavior:
Wallets in the Lower Score Ranges (0-600):

These wallets consistently show a was_liquidated value of 1.0 (or liquidation_call_count > 0), indicating that every wallet in these lowest tiers has experienced at least one liquidation event. This confirms the strong negative weighting of liquidation_call_count in the scoring logic.

Their repay_ratio tends to be very low (close to 0), highlighting a failure to repay borrowed amounts effectively.

The borrow_to_deposit_ratio is notably high in these ranges (especially 201-400 where it's 75.84), suggesting significant over-leveraging relative to their deposits. The net_borrow_value is also high, indicating substantial outstanding debt.

total_transactions and activity_duration_days are generally lower compared to high-scoring wallets, pointing to less sustained or less responsible engagement.

Wallets in the Higher Score Ranges (601-1000):

Dominantly, wallets in the 801-1000 range show an Avg. Was Liquidated of nearly 0 (0.02), signifying that very few of these wallets have ever faced liquidation. This is the primary driver for their high scores.

The repay_ratio in the 801-1000 range is significantly higher (0.61) compared to lower tiers, indicating a better propensity to repay.

While total_transactions and total_deposit_value can vary, these wallets generally show more balanced borrow_to_deposit_ratio (around 0.99 in the top range, with the cap applied) or are primarily depositors.

The transition from 601-800 to 801-1000 is primarily marked by a drastic reduction in liquidation events and an improvement in repay_ratio. This highlights the effectiveness of these features in differentiating "good" from "bad" actors in this dataset.

Conclusion:

The rule-based credit scoring model effectively leverages key DeFi behavioral metrics, particularly liquidation_call_count and repay_ratio, to differentiate between risky and responsible wallet activities. The current dataset heavily features high-scoring wallets, which may reflect typical user behavior on Aave V2 or suggest opportunities to refine the scoring weights for a more granular distribution if a wider range of "risk" is required.
